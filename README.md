=========

A CSS methodology applied to a nonintrusive framework.

Heavily based on [DRY CSS](http://www.slideshare.net/jeremyclarke/dry-css-a-dontrepeatyourself-methodology-for-creating-efficient-unified-and-scalable-stylesheets) (by [Jeremy Clarke](http://simianuprising.com/)) and [OOCSS](http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css) (with some BEM and SMACSS), bundled with helpful selectors and a dead simple flex-based layout system.

Fell free to use it as a start point for your front-end projects.

### Documentation

Please, read our [documentation](https://josantana.gitbooks.io/first/content/) for more information about our methodology and all CSS modules bundled in our framework.
