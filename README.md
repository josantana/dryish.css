upDRY.css
=========

A CSS methodology heavily based on [DRY CSS](http://www.slideshare.net/jeremyclarke/dry-css-a-dontrepeatyourself-methodology-for-creating-efficient-unified-and-scalable-stylesheets) (by [Jeremy Clarke](http://simianuprising.com/)) and [OOCSS](http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css), with some BEM and SMACSS. Bundled with helpful selectors and a super simple flex-based layout system.

Fell free to use it as a start point for your front-end projects.
